# Policy Analysis 

This set of exercises provides an introduction to designing and running a policy analysis on the HPC using Stella Simulator. Although these can be set up and run with standard software packages (e.g., Stella Architect, Vensim) through the user interface, there are advantages of setting and running a policy analysis as a script on the HPC, especially for models with larger sets of potential intervention points and parameter space where one might want to conduct a sensitivity analysis of selected policies.
